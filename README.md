- Initialization (good?)
- From fetch to socket (DONE?)
- Check over gameHandlers, they might not do what i want
- Guest resctrictions (no alliances done - what more?)
- Better response system with colors - line breaks etc
- term.write system (also change everything to (eol?) and writeln)
- set name without auth
- not authenticated, save as guest object, save on login?
- name command in chat too
- unique names generator for alliances?
- autocomplete for /join with available user.alliance[] or the way socket keeps track of the rooms.
- tab suggestions on multiple lines causes rerender on new lines...
- test edit mode

after refactor broken:

- setname (name)
- line breaks
